# image-compare-matrix
Compares 2 images finds the difference between them by using matrix operations. MATLAB Project

Things to do first:

1)You need 2 images adn add them into A,A2 variables (A2 is the clean image of A,A is the image that is going to being analyzed)

2)Set up the Dtt variable.For do that ,you need to test it by running program its the maximum pixel difference between A and A2.

3)If your image to bright or too dark you need to set C variable to higher(bright image) or lower (dark image)

4)If you want brightness analysis you need to set the lazres1 variable
